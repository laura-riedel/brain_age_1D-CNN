# Master Thesis: Evaluating a Lightweight 1D-CNN for Brain Age Prediction

_(work in progress)_

## Structure
- **data:** doesn't contain the data itself but supplementary files
- **src:** all things code; further divided into my brain_age_prediction package, data preparations, and different experimental settings

More detailed information can be found in the directories themselves.
